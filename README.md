**All the models explored are well documented with plots and performance metrics. [Here](https://github.com/Gama99/Facial-Expression-Recognition/blob/master/CNN.ipynb) it is.**

### Face-Expressions-Recognition

Train a facial expression classification model with the Keras TensorFlow library, read facial expressions from your webcam, adding facial landmarking to track your eyes to determine awareness!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed TensorFlow, Dlib, Numpy, Scipy, IMutils, OpenCV, Pandas, Argparse, Scikitplot, Seaborn.

### Execution guide
1. Make sure the necessary prerequisites are installed on your system
2. Download or gitclone the repository

3. Type the following command inside the directory on your terminal
```
 python3 iEmotion.py -m <model_to_be_used>
```
You can load your on model in `/outputs/model` or selected one of the available ones, the available models performance and explanation can be accessed [Here](https://github.com/Gama99/Facial-Expression-Recognition/blob/master/CNN.ipynb)
